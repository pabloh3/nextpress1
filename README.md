# Nextpress Beta

A self-hostable WordPress-compatible CMS built in JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Quick Start

Get started quickly with local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pabloh3/nextpress1 nextpress
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This uses [PGlite](https://pglite.dev/) (embedded PostgreSQL) for development, so you do not need Docker locally.

## Self-Hosting

### NextPress CLI

The [**`@nextpress-org/cli`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nextpress-org/cli) package adds a **`nextpress`** command so you can **provision a server**, **refresh** it over time, **check** how it is doing, and **tear it down** when you need to, without hand-maintaining long shell recipes. Commands include **`install`**, **`upgrade`**, **`reload`**, **`restart`**, **`status`**, **`logs`**, and **`uninstall`**. Use **`install --version <tag>`** when you want a fixed release instead of the default **`latest`**.

```bash
sudo npm install -g @nextpress-org/cli
sudo nextpress install
```

More options and notes are in [`packages/cli/README.md`](packages/cli/README.md).

*NextPress can be self-hosted anywhere Docker runs.*
